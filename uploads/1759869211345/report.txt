Absolutely, here's a list of recommendations based on the given points and additional best practices that I noticed while reviewing some parts in your current codebase (or at least an internal project): 

1) Keep Methods under 20 lines - In Java there are no hard-and-fast rules about how long methods need to be. The ideal length of a method is usually dependent on the complexity involved, not just its declaration size or execution time: if it's only doing one thing and does so well (it makes good use of local variables), then keep up with such short functions as they are easier for maintenance purposes - shorter methods also tend to be more efficient.

2) Use Meaningful Variable Names- If the variable name is not immediately clear about what its purpose, make sure you add a comment explaining why it's called that way in your codebase: e.g., "i" instead of just saying 'index', or use descriptive names for collections like List and Map (for instance).
   
3) Add Unit Tests - As I mentioned before this is important but also very specific to certain types/operations, here's a few points that you could add: 
   i. For the function which calculates total marks of each student from their scores in different subjects and then find out who has scored highest mark among all students; write unit test for it using mock objects (mockito or similar). This way we can ensure our code is tested by people not just ourselves, thereby reducing bugs/failures.
    iii) For methods which deal with database operations e.g., save student details and get the list of a particular course students have enrolled in; write unit test for it using mock objects (mockito or similar).  Similar to above point but focusing on these specific functionalities that interact directly/influently with DB system, like our current workload is focused here
    iii) Finally if there are any APIs calls where we make a request from the client and then expect some response. Write unit tests for them (like verifying correctness of expected HTTP status codes).  Also ensure to cover edge cases as well when testing these types operations, e.g., null or wrong input data scenario
